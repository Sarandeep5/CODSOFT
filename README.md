Project Details
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, and ticket class.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Utilized the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, encompassing passenger details like age, gender, and class.

Data Preprocessing: Addressed missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed survival rates across different demographics and visualized data distributions.

Model Building: Implemented classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics and cross-validation techniques.

Learnings:

Enhanced skills in data cleaning and preprocessing.

Gained proficiency in applying classification algorithms.

Developed a deeper understanding of model evaluation metrics.


2. Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify Iris flowers into species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

Key Steps:

Data Overview: Explored the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Data Preprocessing: Ensured data cleanliness and handled any inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature distributions and relationships to understand data patterns.

Model Building: Applied classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

Learnings:

Developed expertise in handling classification tasks.

Learned to interpret model evaluation metrics effectively.

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Objective: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Utilized a dataset containing credit card transaction details, including transaction amount, time, and labels indicating fraudulence.

Data Preprocessing: Addressed class imbalance, normalized transaction amounts, and encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed transaction patterns and identified potential indicators of fraud.

Model Building: Developed classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests.

Model Evaluation: Measured model performance using precision, recall, F1-score.

Learnings:

Gained experience in dealing with imbalanced datasets.
